    <ul>
        <li> To navigate the Union, please refer back to the main interactive map</li>
        <li> If we had the time, this page would provide written and visual directions to the user's target location </li>
        <li> An interactive map would also be provided that gives customized directions based off of the start and end locations provided </li>
        <li> A solution to cater towards the blind would be to use constantly push out vibrations on the phone and as the user gets closer the vibrations are more frequent </li>
    </ul>
