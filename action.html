    <p> Welcome! </p>

    <ul>
        <li> Please reference the map below </li>
        <li> If we had the time, this page would utilize a PHP file to take in the form input and interpret it to generate instructions on how to get to the destination </li>
        <li> An interactive map would also be provided that gives customized directions based off of the start and end locations provided </li>
        <li> A solution to cater towards the blind would be to use constantly push out vibrations on the phone and as the user gets closer the vibrations are more frequent </li>
    </ul>
